This C++ code sets up a basic OpenGL window using GLUT (OpenGL Utility Toolkit) for rendering. Here's a breakdown of what each part of the code does:

### Code Explanation:

- `#include <GL/glut.h>`: Includes the GLUT header file, which provides functions for setting up an OpenGL window and handling user input.

- `void showScreen()`: Defines the `showScreen` function, which is responsible for rendering graphics in the OpenGL window.

- `glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT)`: Clears the color and depth buffers, preparing the screen for rendering.

- `glBegin(GL_TRIANGLES)`, `glVertex2f()`, `glEnd()`: Specifies drawing commands to render a triangle. It defines three vertices (-0.5, -0.5), (0.5, -0.5), and (0.0, 0.5) that form a triangle.

- `glutSwapBuffers()`: Swaps the front and back buffers to display the rendered image onto the screen in a windowed environment.

- `int main(int argc, char** argv)`: The main function, the entry point of the program.

  - `glutInit(&argc, argv)`: Initializes GLUT and passes command-line arguments.
  
  - `glutInitDisplayMode(GLUT_RGBA | GLUT_DOUBLE | GLUT_DEPTH)`: Sets the display mode with options for RGBA color, double buffering, and depth testing.
  
  - `glutInitWindowSize(500, 500)`, `glutInitWindowPosition(0, 0)`: Sets the initial window size and position.
  
  - `glutCreateWindow("OpenGL Coding Practice")`: Creates a window with the specified title.
  
  - `glutDisplayFunc(showScreen)`, `glutIdleFunc(showScreen)`: Register `showScreen` as the function to render the graphics continuously.
  
  - `glutMainLoop()`: Enters the GLUT event-processing loop, continuously rendering the graphics and handling user input until the program exits.

### Functionality:

This code initializes an OpenGL window, sets it up for rendering, and continuously displays a triangle within that window. The `showScreen` function is responsible for clearing the screen, defining the triangle vertices, and swapping buffers to display the rendered content. The program runs in an infinite loop, continually redrawing the triangle as specified in the `showScreen` function.
